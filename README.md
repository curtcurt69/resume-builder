Resume Builder using React, Node, Axios, and ChatGPT.
The application consists of a form where a user puts their work information, this data is posted to the server which then sends a request to openAI to write commamds to chatgpt to build a resume 
from the given data and returns a complete resume. React then gets the resume text and structures the content and styles it with css.
